Implementation of Operations Research algorithms in Java

Including:

Genetic Algorithm for solving knapsack problem by using binary codes, plan selection problem by using integer codes and traveling-salesman problem(TSP) or sequencing problem by using sequence codes.

Simulated Annealing algorithm for solving TSP or sequencing problem in particular.

Ant-Colony Algorithm, or to be more specific, ant-colony system and ant-cycle model which are two common instances of Ant-Colony Algorithm have been implemented to solve the TSP problem. You may find through the given examples that Ant-Colony Algorithm apparently out-performs the other intelligent optimization algorithms for solving basic TSP.

Several graph algorithms have also been proposed, including max flow, min span tree, and also shortest path.
